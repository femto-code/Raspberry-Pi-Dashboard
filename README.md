## Features

- Live surveillance of RPi hardware (CPU temperature, frequency, loads etc.) with customizable warning thresholds
- Detailed software/hardware information (web server, PHP, storage / partition workload, core voltage, plugged USB devices, kernel version, model specifications, OS, CPU, network config)
- Protected access with password login ([configure password](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#configure-password-manually))
- Power (shutdown/reboot) Raspberry Pi with scheduling options ([setup instructions](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#enable-shutdown--reboot-optional))
- Responsive mobile web-app
- Dark Theme (manual / auto)

> Update your existing dashboard setup by navigating to project root folder and running `git pull` in the terminal. Please keep in mind, this only works if there are no changes in the workspace.

### ❗ If you run into issues and getting error message "Permission denied" or "unable to open file": [see issue #22](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/22) or [read here](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#valid-permissions) for help and instructions to solve. ❗

## Download and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Running Web Server (e.g. *Lighttpd* or *Apache*) with *PHP* installed
- Installed *Git* (comes preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS / formerly Raspbian as well as other Linux distros)
- Valid permissions within `/var/www/html`

#### Valid permissions

The following configuration is the commonly recommended set-up for your web server folder and is meant to be secure to a certain level (with the **minimum** need of permissions):

1. First, make sure `www-data` group exists and add your current user to that system group:<br>
_(if you are using another distro than Raspberry Pi OS the username of web server can differ)_<br>
`sudo groupadd www-data`<br>
`sudo usermod -a -G www-data www-data`<br>
`sudo usermod -a -G www-data <yourlogin>` (replace `<yourlogin>` with your username)

1. Second, give the ownership of web folder to the `www-data` group and *your* user.<br>The following commands ensure that you have _full_ access on the files within the web folder while group members (`www-data`) cannot edit/write for security reasons:<br>
`sudo chown -R <yourlogin>:www-data /var/www/html` (replace `<yourlogin>` with your username)<br>
`sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html`

3. Reboot your RPi (for permission changes to take effect)

### Setup project

- navigate to your web folder: `cd /var/www/html`
- clone this GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/femto-code/Rasberry-Pi-Dashboard.git <your_subfolder_name>`<br>(replace `<your_subfolder_name>` with a name of your choice accordingly, you can also rename the base folder at any time afterwards)
- ***Alternatively*** download and extract ZIP file from [releases](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/releases)
- Run in a terminal to set valid permissions:
  - `sudo chown -R <yourlogin>:www-data /var/www/html/<your_subfolder_name>`<br>(replace `<yourlogin>` with your username)
  - `sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/<your_subfolder_name>`
  - this will allow the `www-data` user exclusively to write/edit (7**7**5) files **only in your dashboard folder**!
> An erroneous permission typically results in the situation where the user responsible for web server (e.g. `www-data`) does not have rights to create/modify the local config file for saving your dashboard adjustments (your custom thresholds, password etc.). In this case, the dashboard won't work at all and will throw this error.
- **DONE!** Open web browser with URL: `http://IP_OF_YOUR_RPI/<your_subfolder_name>`

## Additional configuration / Help

#### Display core voltage (or other hardware info) output (optional)
- If you want to see advanced hardware information (core voltage, advanced model information) on your dashboard instance:
  - run in a terminal: `sudo usermod -aG video www-data` 
>If you do not use Raspberry Pi OS, but e.g. Ubuntu, you do have to install `libraspberrypi-bin` by running `sudo apt install libraspberrypi-bin`.

##### Background
The `vcgencmd` command (specifically dedicated to RPi firmware) is a system command that requires certain hardware rights. Therefore one has to grant this particular right (to read hardware info) to e.g. `www-data` (under which web server is running). This is achieved by adding this user to a designated system group called *video*, which the standard user pi is part of by default.
- only comes preinstalled on *Raspberry Pi OS*
- in case of problems: please comment on [#12](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/12) (or [new issue](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/new))

#### Enable shutdown / reboot (optional)

> Recommended only, if your RPi is **not** accessible over the Internet!

In order to use the remote shutdown functionality you have to give the user `www-data` advanced rights for running one specific command:
1. Run `sudo visudo` to open the editor for adjusting user rights
2. **Be careful what you change here!**<br>Just add the following at the **end** of the file: <br>`www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown`
3. **Reboot** your RPi to enable shutdown from another device (connected to same local network as your RPi).

#### Configure password (manually)

- Please be aware that there is a **more user-friendly** way now by using the dashboards options modal. However, the following manual way of changing the password might be helpful
  - in case of wrong permissions (user `www-data` cannot change settings for you - [see issue #22](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/22) or [read here](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard#valid-permissions) for help and instructions to solve)
  - forgotten password (and access to dashboard therefore impossible)

1. Go to [https://www.md5-generator.de/](https://www.md5-generator.de/) and generate *MD5 encrypted passphrase*.
2. Open `local.config` (dynamically created at first start) and apply your custom passphrase string (generated in **step 1**) as follows (don't alter other lines):
```
[...]
'general' =>
  array (
    [...]
    'pass' => 'YOUR_MD5_PASSPHRASE_HERE',
    [...]
  ),
  [...]
```

#### Disabling password login

If your RaspberryPi is on a private part of the network and you don't want to use a password, you can disable it.
To do this, in the `local.config` file, set the `loginWithPassword` parameter to `0`.
If there is no `loginWithPassword` parameter in your `local.config` file, simply add it after the `pass` option.

Example:
```
[...]
  'general' => 
  array (
    [...]
    'pass' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    'loginWithPassword' => '0',
    [...]
  ),
[...]
```

4. Remember password and enjoy!

> **As always**: Make sure to change the default password (which is **root**) and choose a more secure one at first setup and if your dashboard is accessible on the network.
